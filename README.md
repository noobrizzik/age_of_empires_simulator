# age_of_empires_simulator
This Python simulation was prepared for the Basic Programming 2 course by Ali Rıza Taşkömür, Recep Utku Karabulut, and Burak Taşdelen. Enjoy!

IMPORTANT NOTE! The "gather" command was added for those who want to quickly test the late-game experience (especially for Timuçin Hoca). For a more realistic experience that follows the intended rules of the simulation, please avoid using the "gather" command!
